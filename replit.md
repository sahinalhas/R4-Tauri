# Rehber360 - Student Guidance System

## Overview
Rehber360 is a comprehensive Turkish-language student guidance and management system for educational institutions. It offers tools for student tracking, counseling, risk assessment, behavioral monitoring, and academic performance analysis. A core feature is its AI-powered profile analysis, which generates standardized student profiles from diverse data. The system includes an AI Assistant for local, AI-powered student counseling, supporting OpenAI and Ollama (Llama 3.1) models. Built as a Tauri desktop application with React frontend and Rust backend, Rehber360 aims to drive data standardization and evidence-based interventions for student success.
